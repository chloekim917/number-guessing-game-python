# number-guessing-game-python
A game where a user selects a range of integers in the beginning, confirms that the input range is correct, and the system selects a random number in that range for the user to guess. 
The user then guesses what the system-selected number is using clues that the system gives like 'higher than' and 'lower than' everytime he/she guesses a number. 
The system will print out how many guesses it took for the user to get the number right.
